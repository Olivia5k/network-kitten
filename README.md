# Kitten

**kitten** is a distributed build scheduler.  Think of it as a build agent to
a build system such as Jenkins, but without a central point. All connected
nodes communicate between each other to perform all the tasks traditionally
performed by the central build server.

It is currently in an experimental pre-alpha state; *Here be dragons*.
